On the Stanford system, it is possible to run in either mode. The IV curve runs from a high voltage down to a low voltage. The default low voltage is 0, but it can be changed with the default argument bias_low. The upper end of the IV curve is controlled by bias_high. The voltage is decreased from bias_high to bias_low in steps of size bias_step. To kick the TESs out of the superconducting state to begin the IV curve, a large voltage is supplied that is set by overbias_voltage. The TESs are then dropped down to bias_high (in either high- or low-current mode depending on the boolean high_current_mode), and we wait for a time specified by the optional argument cool_wait (seconds) before beginning the IV curve.\n",

    "The IV script automatically analyzes the data and makes plots. Many channels will produce little more than noise, though, since they are either not connected to TESs or not on the active bias groups. To avoid wasting time on the analysis of unresponsive channels, we set a threshold phase excursion, i.e., a minimum amount that the flux-ramp phase, our raw data, has to change by, and don't analyze channels that move by a smaller amount. This threshold is controlled by the parameter phase_excursion_min and is set in radians. If we refer 1 radian of flux-ramp phase shift to a physical TES current, we find that it is approximately equivalent, within an O(1) factor, to 1 uA."

The analysis then fits the normal portion to get the normal resistance and the correct offset in IV space. What we actually plot is not I vs. V, though. We plot TES current vs. \"bias current\", by which we mean the current flowing on the TES bias lines through the shunt-resistor network. The shunt-resistor network is current biased, so the \"bias current\" is a known quantity as soon as a voltage is set on the bias lines, which we tend to call the \"commanded voltage\". When the TES goes superconducting, we expect the TES current to be exactly equal to the bias current, so we should have a slope of 1 in this portion. Typically, the tracking algorithm does not follow the fast jump in current that occurs when the TES goes fully superconducting, so we insert an offset to the superconducting branch in the analysis to make sure it passes through the origin. This is a bit artificial but has no operational consequences.\n",
