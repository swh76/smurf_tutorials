So even though the blade looks off, the drain voltages for the RF amplifiers in the cryostat are still being provided (since they come directly off of the RTM).  For these blades, after deactivating the carrier, disconnect the cable from the RTM to the cryostat card.  Do not disconnect the cable from the cryostat card to the fridge connector - that could damage the amplifiers or MUX chips. \n",
